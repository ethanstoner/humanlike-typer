```

Or manually:
1. Download [init.ahk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethanstoner/humanlike-typer/main/init.ahk)
2. Save it anywhere (e.g., `Documents\HumanLikeTyper.ahk`)

**Step 3: Run the Script**

- **Double-click** `init.ahk` to run
- Look for the keyboard icon in your system tray

**Step 1: Install AutoHotkey v2** (same as above)

**Step 2: Compile the Script**

1. Right-click `init.ahk`
2. Select **"Compile Script"** from the context menu
3. This creates `init.exe` in the same folder

- No AutoHotkey installation needed on other PCs!

**Optional: Add to Startup**

To run automatically on Windows startup:

2. **Click into a text field**
3. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+V`** or right-click tray icon ‚Üí "Type Clipboard"
4. **Watch it type!**

## Troubleshooting

### Script doesn't run?

**Make sure you have AutoHotkey v2 installed:**
- Download and install from [autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)

**If you see "This script requires AutoHotkey v2.0":**
- Uninstall AutoHotkey v1.x
- Install AutoHotkey v2.0+ from [autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)

### Nothing happens when I press the hotkey?

1. Check if the script is running (look for tray icon)
2. Some applications block hotkeys (games, elevated apps)
3. Try right-clicking tray icon ‚Üí "Type Clipboard" instead

### Settings window doesn't appear?

1. Make sure script is running as administrator if you're in an elevated app
2. Try reloading the script (right-click tray icon ‚Üí Reload)

### Typing is strange or has issues?

Make sure you're focused in a **text input field** before triggering the typing. The script types wherever your cursor is focused.

### Script conflicts with other AutoHotkey scripts?

If you have other AHK scripts running:
- They should coexist fine
- If conflicts occur, check for duplicate hotkeys
- Consider using `#SingleInstance Force` in your scripts

## Security Notes

- **Always review scripts before running** - You can open `init.ahk` in any text editor
- The script only:
  - Reads your clipboard when you trigger it
  - Simulates keyboard typing
  - Creates a settings GUI window
  - Shows a tray icon
- **No network access, no file access, no data collection**

## Uninstall

**If running as script:**
1. Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Exit
2. Delete `init.ahk`

**If using compiled .exe:**
1. Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Exit
2. Delete `init.exe`
3. Remove from Startup folder if you added it there

**Restore original files:**
```powershell
# Remove the script
del "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\HumanLikeTyper.ahk"
```

## Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Action |
